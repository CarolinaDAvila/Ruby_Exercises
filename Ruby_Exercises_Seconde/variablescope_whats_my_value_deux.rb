What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a

answer: 

the answer is still 7. the variable initialized in line 1 is not the same variable
initialized in line 3. 
Method definitions are self contained. 

is this variable shadowing?
