=begin
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal

answer: This code should return 'Breakfast'.
Although you dont need to explicitly call a return on line 3 because every method returns the 
evaluated result or return value of the last line that is executed. 
=end 

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal
