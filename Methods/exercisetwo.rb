# 1. Youre assigning local variable x to the integer 2. 2
# 2. You are printing out x = 2, and it will output x = 2 but return nil because puts always returns nil. nil
# 3. You are using p instead of puts to print "Joe". It will print an outcome of "Joe" as well as return "Joe"."Joe"
# 4. you are assigning local variable four to the string four. "four"
# 5. you are printing the local variable something that is assigned "nothing". The computer will print nothing with a nil next to it. THE PRINT METHOD DOES NOT APPEND A NEW LINE
